            <h2>Advent of the War Sun</h2>
            <p class="complexity">Complexity: 1</p>
            <p>At the end of setup, all players other than the Embers of Muaat player gain the War Sun unit upgrade technology. The Embers of Muaat player purges their faction-specific promissory note, unlocks their commander, and places 1 additional War Sun in their home system.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="age-of-commerce" class="event-card">
            <h2>Age of Commerce</h2>
            <p class="complexity">Complexity: 1</p>
            <p>Players do not have to be neighbors to perform transactions with each other. Players do not have a maximum number of commodities; when they refresh commodities, they gain a number of commodities equal to their commodities value instead. Players can share non-faction technology with other players as part of a transaction. When sharing technology, the receiving player gains that technology from their own deck; the sharing player does not lose the technology.</p>

            <h2>Age of Exploration</h2>
            <p class="complexity">Complexity: 2</p>
            <p>Relics only require 2 matching fragments be purged instead of 3. The Naaz-Rokha Alliance's Fabrication faction ability and Black Market Forgery promissory note do not require purged fragments to match. All players can perform the following action: ACTION: Exhaust Dark Energy Tap and choose a non-home edge system that contains your ships to roll a 1 die. On a result of 1 - 4, draw a random unused red tile; on a result of 5 - 10, draw an random unused blue tile. Place that tile adjacent to the chosen system so that it is touching 2 non-home systems. Place a frontier token in the system if it does not contain any planets.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="age-of-fighters" class="event-card">
            <h2>Age of Fighters</h2>
            <p class="complexity">Complexity: 3</p>
            <p>During setup, all players gain the Fighters II unit upgrade technology; the Naalu Collective player gains Hybrid Crystal Fighter II technology instead.

            <h2>Call of the Void</h2>
            <p class="complexity">Complexity: 1</p>
            <p>After you move 1 or more units into the active system, if that system is in The Fracture, gain 1 command token. When you activate a system in The Fracture, apply +1 to the move values of each of your ships.</p>

            <h2>Civilized Society</h2>
            <p class="complexity">Complexity: 2</p>
            <p>During setup, turn all public objectives face up. There is no limit to the number of public objectives a player may score during the status phase. The game does not immediately end when a player reaches the required number of victory points; instead, it ends at the end of that round's status phase, and the player with the most victory points wins. In the case of a tie, the tied players total the influence values of their controlled planets and their unspent trade goods; the player or players with the highest total win the game.</p>
        </div>

            <h2>Conventions of War Abandoned</h2>
            <p class="complexity">Complexity: 3</p>
            <p>Each hit produced by BOMBARDMENT rolls destroys 3 units instead of 1. Players that have the X-89 BACTERIAL WEAPON technology can perform the following action: ACTION: Exhaust X-89 BACTERIAL WEAPON to choose 1 planet in a system that contains 1 of your units that has BOMBARDMENT; purge its planet card and all attachments or legendary planet ability cards associated with it. You are eliminated if all of your home system's planet cards are purged. </p>
        </div>
        <div id="cosmic-phenomenae" class="event-card">
            <h2>Cosmic Phenomenae</h2>
            <p class="complexity">Complexity: 2</p>
        <p>Anomalies are adjusted as follows:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Nebulae:</strong> The defender applied +3 to each of their ship's combat rolls in the nebula instead.</li>

            <p class="complexity">Complexity: 2</p>
            <p>At the end of setup, shuffle the reference cards that correspond to each faction in play. Each player draws 1 of those card and takes all leaders that correspond to that faction. They belong to that player for the remainder of the game. Then, each player unlocks their commander. The Obsidian/Firmament player does not participate in the Cultural Exchange Program. Instead, they begin the game with "The Obsidian" relic.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="dangerous-wilds" class="event-card">
            <h2>Dangerous Wilds</h2>
            <p class="complexity">Complexity: 1</p>
            <p>During setup, place neutral infantry on each hazardous planet equal to that planet's resource value.

        <div id="hidden-agenda" class="event-card">
            <h2>Hidden Agenda</h2>
            <p class="complexity">Complexity: 2</p>
            <p>During the agenda phase, only the speaker can talk; all other players must remain silent except when declaring action cards. Transactions cannot be performed during this phase. When voting, players secretly and simultaneously write their desired outcome and number of votes and pass them to the speaker. After all players have voted, the speaker secretly tallies the results and reveals only the totals to the other players; the speaker reveals who voted for which outcome only when required to resolve the outcome. The Argent Flight's votes are public and are known before the other players vote. </p>
        </div>
        <div id="mercenaries-for-hire" class="event-card">
            <h2>Mercenaries for Hire</h2>
            <p class="complexity">Complexity: 1</p>
            <p>At the start of the game, shuffle the alliance cards that correspond to the factions not in play and place them in the common play area with the card fronts faceup; this is the mercenary deck. All players can perform the following action: ACTION: Spend 3 trade goods to gain the top card of the mercenary deck and place it in your play area. Players can use the abilities of the mercenaries in their play area.</p>

            <p class="complexity">Complexity: 2</p>
            <p>During setup, players are dealt 1 fewer blue tile. Before creating the galaxy, shuffle the reference cards for factions not being played and deal 1 to each player. In speaker order, each player places that faction's home system in the second ring, equidistant from players' home systems. Then, that player places 3 neutral infantry on that system's planets, split as evenly as possible. These systems are minor faction systems and do not count as home systems. When a player controls each planet in a minor faction system, they take that factions alliance card from the deck or from the player that owned it previously. Planets in minor faction systems gain all three planet traits (cultural, industrial, and hazardous).</p>
        </div>
        <div id="monuments-to-the-ages" class="event-card">

There can only be 3 monuments in play at once. At the start of the status phase, place 1 commodity beneath each monument; each monument is worth 1 victory point to the play that controls its planet for every 3 commodities beneath it. When a player gains control of a planet that contains a monument, they may destroy that monument. </p>

When a player gains control of a home system that has commodities, they move those commodities to a planet they control in their own home system. All players can perform the following action: ACTION: Discard 10 commodities from planets in your home system to gain 1 victory point.</p>
